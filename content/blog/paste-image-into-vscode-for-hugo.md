In this post I will detail how to install and configure 

#### Final config
Images are saved into the folder like static/blog/article-name/image1.png
It is referenced into the body as ![alt-text](image_name.png)
It will be inserted and displayed into the blog post when rendered

Pages like about/index/main images are stored into the assets folder (maybe for resizing?)

Could the pictures be moved with a pre-hook?what could i precheck with the prehook .gitignore *.jpg para el directorio content?

Pending steps: delete testing1,2.jpg.png y testing-image-route
