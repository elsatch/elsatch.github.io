#### Introduction

January 2022. A new year starts, inmersed in COVID-19 pandemic. It's that time of the year when everyone sets new goals and starts new projects. In my case, that would mean envisioning another couple of new inititives, with their own branding, blogs, social media, etc. But this year will be different for me!

#### Launching a blog

One of my goals for this year is to focus on Python for data science and data engineering. Initially, I don't plan to apply this knowledge to search for an external job, but to incorporate it into my daily practice.

For the last six or seven years, I have run La Hora Maker podcast and Youtube channel. When you publish content regularly about a topic, people expect you to keep on moving forward under that topic umbrella. Does Python fit into La Hora Maker audience? Does data science fit? Opendata?

As I started exploring the data engineering lanscape, I realized there are so many interesting projects using Python. All the contents and repositories are mainly in English. All interactions around the topic are in English.

I want to join the conversation and share my insights, questions, a-ha moments with other practitioners. Instead of launching some kind of "Data Engineering Mastered" blog, I opted for a smaller, more humble approach.

Most of the conversation nowadays is happening in Github, so I am launching a simple page in English using Github pages. I will use Hugo and a simple theme to start and keep growing from there. I don't expect it to become massive but mostly a personal journal of sorts. At least, I hope it will simplify dumping ideas about data and tech on the Internet :)
