It is created by Thomas Feldmann and it\u0026rsquo;s available from his github repository. Yesterday, version 2.0 of the tool was launched. As I was reading all new features on the changelog, I began to reflect on my current use cases plus all the new options to explore.\nIt is my goal to use organize as much as possible to help me:\n Sorting all my pictures and folders Arranging paper and digital invoices and expenses Creating more robust backups Migrating all my files from Dropbox to Google Drive/local NAS  Note: In this article, we will be using the new Organize v2 syntax. Please refer to this guide if you want to know the differences from the v1 syntax.\nHow does organize work? Organize is a command line program that can be installed from pip/git/brew.\nOnce installed you can execute it from your terminal (or powershell window). The program reads the rules to process from a file, known as the organize config file. You can edit the rules executing:\norganize edit By default, this will open vim to edit the file, but you can use any text editor. This file\u0026rsquo;s format is in YAML\nConfiguration file is based upon the following elements:\n Rules Locations Filters Actions  So each rule can target to one or more locations (folders), filtering the results in several ways and applying the actions for the filtered results. When we run organize, it will read the config file and execute the rules in the given order. Given they are the building blocks of our file organization strategy, let\u0026rsquo;s explore these rules in more detail.\nSample rules for organizing files There are countless ways to organize your files. Maybe you sort your files by project or by date. Maybe you prefer to rename files or tag them using macsosx built-in features. Organize rules are super flexible, trying to accommodate all kinds of scenarios.\nBefore we dive into the actual rules, let\u0026rsquo;s describe some sorting mechanisms in plain words. For example:\n All my installation files in the download folder that are older than three months should be deleted All my photos in my computer should be renamed to include the date and the model of the camara that was used to take the shoots. All my invoices in project folders and pdf format should be copied into the fiscal_information folder, sorted by quarter, based on the content of the invoice. All my raw videos in the published folder should be copied to Dropbox and Google Drive for archival.  These rules can be easily replicated in Organize, using the four elements outlined in the previous section.\nAs an example, let\u0026rsquo;s share one sample rule configuration. This rule will move all files from the Desktop folder, older than 30 days, to a folder called old_items:\n# Sample organize configuration rules: - name: Move files on desktop older than 30 days to old_items locations: \u0026#34;~/Desktop\u0026#34; filters: - created: days: 30 actions: - move: \u0026#34;~/Desktop/old_items\u0026#34; Organize command-line operations YAML files can be hard to create right without the proper editor. Fortunately, you can verify your config file by running:\norganize check Organize can be executed in simulation mode to verify if the rules would affect the expected files and folders. It will also return the results of the different actions, but without altering your files in any way. To run organize in simulation mode run:\norganize sim Once you are happy about the results, you can just process the rules doing:\norganize run You will see in the console all different operations happening in real time, until all rules are processed for the target locations.\nInitial thoughts about Organize When I first encountered organize, it looked like the perfect tool to automate renaming and moving files inside my computer. Then I started creating the rules and simulating them. So it looked like a tool for interactive sessions. Initially, it made no sense. But the more I used it, the more it grew on me.\nWith version 2, Organize can fulfill even more roles in my systems. In these series of articles, I plan to explore the multiple use cases for the tool, offering sample configurations and new uses that where not possible in previous versions.\nPhoto credits: Photo by Erol Ahmed on Unsplash.\n","date":"February 8, 2022","image":"https://elsatch.github.io/images/post/introduction-organize-tool_hu8f64c5febe8d477323813b82223057ec_3507452_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/blog/introduction-to-organize-tool/","title":"Introduction to Organize tool"},{"categories":["thoughts"],"contents":"Introduction January 2022. A new year starts, inmersed in COVID-19 pandemic. It\u0026rsquo;s that time of the year when everyone sets new goals and starts new projects. In my case, that would mean envisioning another couple of new inititives, with their own branding, blogs, social media, etc. But this year will be different for me!\nLaunching a blog One of my goals for this year is to focus on Python for data science and data engineering. Initially, I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to apply this knowledge to search for an external job, but to incorporate it into my daily practice.\nFor the last six or seven years, I have run La Hora Maker podcast and Youtube channel. When you publish content regularly about a topic, people expect you to keep on moving forward under that topic umbrella. Does Python fit into La Hora Maker audience? Does data science fit? Opendata?\nAs I started exploring the data engineering lanscape, I realized there are so many interesting projects using Python. All the contents and repositories are mainly in English. All interactions around the topic are in English.\nI want to join the conversation and share my insights, questions, a-ha moments with other practitioners. Instead of launching some kind of \u0026ldquo;Data Engineering Mastered\u0026rdquo; blog, I opted for a smaller, more humble approach.\nMost of the conversation nowadays is happening in Github, so I am launching a simple page in English using Github pages. I will use Hugo and a simple theme to start and keep growing from there. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to become massive but mostly a personal journal of sorts. At least, I hope it will simplify dumping ideas about data and tech on the Internet :)\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.\n","date":"February 7, 2022","image":"https://elsatch.github.io/images/post/launching-blog-2022_hu7d6bde8b9d7510d626361d118f92c933_2354890_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/blog/launching-a-blog-in-2022/","title":"Launching a blog in 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
